# todoList POC

Wanted to try something else that the regular LAMP stack I was studying at school everyday...
So on a week-end, I came up with this idea : a classic todo list, using webSockets and Vue.js.

Eventually I had a POC using :

- PHP for the back-end
- Rachet webSocket framework for back-end / front-end comm
- Vue.js front end with a bit of JSquery (I know, Iknow...)

Anyway, the whole thing works almost perfectly !
Enough at least to make me take to cooking a v1
